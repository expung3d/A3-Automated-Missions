# Automated Missions

## What It Does
Automated Missions creates randomized and automated missions for a Zeus. These are mostly meant to buy time, however, over time I've aimed to make this into a mission creator.

## Mission Types

Helicrashes

Convoys

HVTs in Towns

Garrisonned Towns

More soon...


## Notes
Currently only setup for Altis
WIP, expect bugs
