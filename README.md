# Automated Missions

## What It Does
Automated Missions creates randomized and automated missions for a Zeus. These are mostly meant to buy time, however, over time I've aimed to make this into a mission creator.

## Mission Types

 - Helicrashes
 - Convoys
 - HVTs in Towns
 - Garrisoned Towns
 - More soon...


## Notes
 - Convoy mission types are only configured for Altis. 
 - WIP, expect bugs
